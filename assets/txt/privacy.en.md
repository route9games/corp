<ins>Personal Data Collected from Third Parties</ins>

Most of the personal data that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our games or interact with our Services. However, we may also collect personal data from third parties in the following circumstances:

- <b>Social Media</b> : When you interact with our Services through various social media networks, such as when you "Like" our official page on Facebook or follow us, or share our official page’s content on Google, Facebook, X, or other social networks, we may receive some information about you. The data we receive depends on your privacy settings with the social network and may include name, profile picture and friends list. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites, social media networks, and services before making your personal data publicly available and/or linking or connecting your account on one service to other services.
- <b>App Marketplaces</b> : When you download our mobile applications or make in-app payments through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other app marketplaces, we receive personal data about your device, account and payments. We do not receive access to your credit card or bank account data when you make in-app payments through these app marketplaces. The personal data we receive from these third-party companies will depend on your privacy settings with them.
- <b>Information we receive from authentication services you connect to our Service</b> : Some parts of our Services may allow you to log in through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook, Google and Apple. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us, which could include your name, email address and user ID associated with the third party, profile picture, and, in the case of Facebook, the names and avatars of your Facebook friends who are already playing our games. The data we receive is dependent on that third party's policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. Where available, you will also be able to see which of your friends are playing the same game and their progress through the games (and they will be able to see you and your progress) or access other functionality we make available in our games and other Services, such as inviting friends to play. You can choose not to allow us to access your email address in the Facebook dialog box you see the first time you associate your Facebook account with your Route9 Inc. profile.
Logging in with Facebook will not allow us to post anything to your page without your permission, and we will not receive any information about your Facebook friends who do not play our games. If you do not wish your Facebook friends to be able to see your progress in our games, you can prevent this by disconnecting your Facebook account from our games and updating your app permissions from within your Facebook settings. If you choose not to connect your Route9 Inc. profile to your Facebook, Google or Apple account, the personal data that we collect when you play our games will be linked to a randomly generated user ID rather than information that could identify you directly, but we will collect device-level identifiers and other information associated with those identifiers described above. We recommend that you read Facebook's Privacy Policy and review your privacy settings from time to time to ensure that you understand fully how your Facebook data is shared.
